# Shopify API Documentation Crawler

I believe that API Libraries should be generated with the very documentation that describes how they work. This is a first stab at that idea.

Within `index.js` there is code that crawls the [Shopify API documentation](https://docs.shopify.com/api) and goes through each endpoint gathering it's information.
